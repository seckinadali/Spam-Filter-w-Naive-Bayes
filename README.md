# Building a Spam Filter Using Naive Bayes

In this project we build a spam filter using the multinomial naive Bayes classifier. We use a data set containing 5,572 SMS messages to train and test our model, and our final program has an accuracy rate of 98.74%. The data set can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/sms+spam+collection).
