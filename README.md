# Building a Spam Filter Using Naive Bayes

In this project we build a spam filter using the multinomial naive Bayes algorithm. We use a data set containing 5,572 SMS messages to train and test our model, and our final program has an accuracy rate greater than 98%.

We also apply multinomial naive Bayes, random forest classifier and support vector classifier models from `scikit-learn` to our data set and compare performances of all four models using cross-validation.

The data set we use can be found on [the UCI Machine Learning Depository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/sms+spam+collection).
